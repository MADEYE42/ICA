2. INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

Blind Source Separation (BSS) is a fundamental problem in signal processing and machine 
learning where the goal is to recover unknown source signals from their mixtures without 
having explicit knowledge about the mixing process. Classical examples include the "cocktail 
party problem" in audio processing, where separating individual speakers from a mixed audio 
signal is required.

Two prominent statistical techniques have emerged as leaders in solving BSS problems:

1. Independent Component Analysis (ICA): Based on the assumption that source signals are 
   statistically independent and have non-Gaussian distributions, ICA seeks to find a linear 
   transformation that maximizes the independence of the resulting components.

2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): A variance-based dimensionality reduction technique 
   that identifies orthogonal directions in the data space that capture maximum variance, 
   commonly used for noise reduction and feature extraction.

This project provides an interactive platform to explore, understand, and compare these two 
approaches across different data modalities. By implementing both algorithms on the same data, 
users can observe how different underlying assumptions and optimization criteria lead to 
fundamentally different results.

Application Scope:
- Educational: Teaching signal processing and machine learning concepts
- Research: Comparing algorithm performance on real-world data
- Practical: Separating mixed audio sources and decomposing mixed images
- Analysis: Understanding the mathematical foundations of BSS


3. THEORETICAL FOUNDATION
================================================================================

3.1 CONCEPT OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1.1 Blind Source Separation Problem Statement
The BSS problem can be mathematically formulated as:

    X = A * S + N

Where:
- X: Observed mixed signals (dimension: m × T, where m = number of mixtures, T = time samples)
- A: Unknown mixing matrix (dimension: m × n)
- S: Unknown source signals (dimension: n × T, where n = number of sources)
- N: Additive noise (typically assumed negligible in noiseless BSS)

The goal is to estimate both A and S using only observations of X.

3.1.2 Independent Component Analysis (ICA)
ICA is a statistical technique that separates a multivariate signal into additive, 
statistically independent components. The fundamental assumption is that the source signals 
are:
- Statistically independent: P(s₁, s₂, ..., sₙ) = P(s₁)P(s₂)...P(sₙ)
- Non-Gaussian: At most one source can follow a Gaussian distribution
- Linear mixing: The mixtures are linear combinations of sources

Mathematical Formulation:
ICA seeks to find the unmixing matrix W such that:
    Y = W * X ≈ S

The optimization criterion is based on maximizing non-Gaussianity, typically using:
- Information-theoretic measures (Kullback-Leibler divergence)
- Negentropy: J(y) = E{G(y)} - E{G(ν)}ᵞ, where ν ~ N(0,1)
- Kurtosis or higher-order statistics

3.1.3 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA is a linear dimensionality reduction technique that identifies orthogonal directions 
(principal components) that maximize variance in the data. The mathematical formulation:

Given data matrix X (m × n), PCA seeks directions that maximize variance:
    argmax(w) Var(Xw) = argmax(w) w^T Σ w

Where Σ = (1/m)X^T X is the covariance matrix.

The solution is given by eigenvalue decomposition:
    Σ = U Λ U^T

Where:
- U: Matrix of eigenvectors (principal directions)
- Λ: Diagonal matrix of eigenvalues (variances along each direction)

Key characteristics:
- Orthogonal components: Components are uncorrelated
- Variance preservation: First k components capture maximum variance
- Deterministic: Unique solution (up to sign)
- Gaussian-friendly: Performs well on normally distributed data


3.2 STEPS INVOLVED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2.1 Audio Source Separation Pipeline

Step 1: Audio Input Processing
  - User uploads MP3 or WAV file
  - librosa.load() converts to target sample rate (default 22050 Hz)
  - Audio is resampled to mono for simplicity
  - Normalization: y_normalized = y / (max(|y|) + ε)

Step 2: Synthetic Mixture Creation (for single audio files)
  - Apply bandpass filters to create multiple frequency-separated components
    * Component 1: 50-8000 Hz (speech-like)
    * Component 2: 200-10000 Hz (higher frequency content)
  - Apply time delays using convolution to simulate different arrival times
  - Stack components and center the data (zero mean)
  - Result: n_components × n_samples mixture matrix

Step 3: ICA Decomposition
  - Apply FastICA algorithm to mixture matrix
  - Parameters: n_components (user-defined), max_iter=2000, random_state=0
  - Normalize each component to [−1, +1] range
  - Result: n_components independent sources

Step 4: PCA Decomposition
  - Apply PCA to same mixture matrix
  - Extract n_components principal components
  - Normalize each component
  - Calculate explained variance ratio for each component
  - Result: n_components components sorted by variance

Step 5: Visualization and Analysis
  - Plot original, mixed, and separated waveforms
  - Generate spectrograms using STFT (Short-Time Fourier Transform)
  - Calculate RMS energy for each component
  - Compare variance ratios (PCA) with energy metrics (ICA)

Step 6: Output Generation
  - Export separated components as WAV files
  - Generate comparison statistics and visualizations
  - Provide download links for each component


3.2.2 Image Source Separation Pipeline

Step 1: Image Input Processing
  - User uploads exactly 3 images (JPG, PNG, BMP, TIFF)
  - Convert to grayscale if RGB: img_gray = 0.299*R + 0.587*G + 0.114*B
  - Resize to uniform size (default 256×256)
  - Normalize to [0, 1]: img_norm = (img − min) / (max − min + ε)
  - Flatten each image to 1D vector: (256×256 = 65,536 features)

Step 2: Synthetic Mixing
  - Create random mixing matrix A (3×3) with normal distribution
  - Compute mixed images: X = A @ S
  - Where S is (3 × 65,536) matrix of flattened original images
  - Result: X is (3 × 65,536) mixed data matrix

Step 3: ICA Decomposition
  - Apply FastICA to transposed X.T (65,536 × 3)
  - Use FastICA with n_components=3, max_iter=2000
  - Obtain separated components (3 × 65,536)
  - Reshape each component back to 2D image (256×256)
  - Normalize each image to [0, 1]

Step 4: PCA Decomposition
  - Apply PCA to same transposed data X.T
  - Extract 3 principal components
  - Calculate explained variance ratio for each component
  - Reshape to 2D images and normalize
  - Result: 3 components ordered by variance contribution

Step 5: Comprehensive Visualization
  - Display 4×3 grid: Originals, Mixed, ICA results, PCA results
  - Show mixing matrix A
  - Display statistics: convergence iterations, explained variance

Step 6: Output Generation
  - Export separated images as PNG files
  - Provide download links for each component
  - Generate performance metrics


3.3 HOW IT WORKS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.3.1 Core Algorithm: FastICA

FastICA is an efficient implementation of ICA using fixed-point iterations:

Algorithm Steps:
1. Preprocessing:
   a. Center data: X_centered = X − E[X]
   b. Whiten data: X_white = (Σ^{-1/2}) * X_centered (removes correlations)

2. Initialize: W randomly (orthogonal matrix)

3. For each iteration until convergence:
   a. Update W using fixed-point equation:
      W⁺ = E[X * g(W^T X)^T] − β(W)W
      where g(·) is a nonlinear activation function
      Common choices: g(u) = tanh(u), g(u) = u * exp(−u²/2)
   
   b. Orthogonalize: W ← (W * W^T)^{−1/2} * W
   
   c. Check convergence: ||W_new − W_old|| < tolerance

4. Compute independent components: S = W^T * X_white

3.3.2 Core Algorithm: PCA

PCA Decomposition Process:

1. Center the data: X_centered = X − μ

2. Compute covariance matrix: Σ = (1/n) * X^T * X_centered

3. Eigenvalue decomposition: Σ = U * Λ * U^T

4. Sort eigenvectors by eigenvalues (descending)

5. Select top k eigenvectors: U_k

6. Project onto principal components: Y = U_k^T * X_centered

7. Calculate explained variance ratio:
   explained_var_ratio[i] = λᵢ / Σ(λⱼ for all j)

7.5 FINAL REMARKS

This project successfully bridges the gap between theoretical signal processing and practical 
implementation. By providing an interactive platform for BSS experimentation, it enables both 
learners and practitioners to:

- Understand the fundamental differences between ICA and PCA
- Observe algorithmic behavior on real data
- Compare results visually and quantitatively
- Develop intuition about when to use each method

The application demonstrates that while PCA is a more general and statistically stable technique, 
ICA is specifically designed for and excels at the blind source separation problem when its 
assumptions (independence, non-Gaussianity) are reasonably satisfied.

Future work will focus on extending the platform to more advanced algorithms, additional data 
modalities, and real-time processing capabilities. The codebase provides a solid foundation for 
these extensions and can serve as a basis for research in signal processing and machine learning.
